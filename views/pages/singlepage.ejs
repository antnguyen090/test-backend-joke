      A child asked his father, "How were people born?" So his father said, "Adam and Eve made babies, then their
      babies became adults and made babies, and so on." The child then went to his mother, asked her the same
      question and she told him, "We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now." The child ran back
      to his father and said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was talking about her side of the
      family"
